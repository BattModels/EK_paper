# ElectrochemicalKinetics.jl Demo
This repository contains code used to generate figures for the manuscript that introduces the [ElectrochemicalKinetics.jl](https://github.com/BattModels/ElectrochemicalKinetics.jl) package (link to be added when available). The Project and Manifest files reflect package versions used in generating those figures; of course subsequent updates could be made that render this code unusable and/or change results, so please run with the environment provided for reproducibility.

Also, in several cases, generating the data is time-consuming (several core-hours or more). In these cases, the code to generate the data is commented out and outputs are included in the `data/` folder, which are then read in to make plots.

Individual scripts are titled by figure number and include comments to clarify what is going on. Note that published versions of figures may contain additional annotations added external to this plotting code.
